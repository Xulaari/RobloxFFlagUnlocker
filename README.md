# RobloxFFlagUnlocker

Uses Roblox FFlag's and auto unlocks fps to the monitor refresh rate, without adding more graphics bars like RCO.

## How does it work?

It automatically detects the monitors refresh rate, Then adds 1 to it, For example, 144HZ = 145FPS Cap. You can just press enter and itll use defaults, but you can enter for example, 15. This would equal 160FPS. The same with -15, Which would equal 130FPS. Keep in mind, This was only a personal project for fun.

## Advantages

- Doesen't force your GPU to render as much frames as possible.
- Automatically sets fps cap to your refresh rate for you (+1) 144HZ = 145FPS Cap.
- Doesen't add wacky options, like 21 graphics bars.
